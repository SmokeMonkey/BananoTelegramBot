NOS Telegram Tip Bot

Commands

Thank you for using my services @NOSTipBot!  Below is a list of commands, and a description of how you can interact with me:

• !help: The NOSTipBot will respond to your DM with a list of commands and their functions. If you forget something, use this to get a hint of how to do it!n

• !register: Creates a fresh NOS (XNOS) account address specifically for you.  This is used to store your tips. Make sure to withdraw to a private wallet, as the tip bot is not meant to be a long term storage device for NOS (XNOS).

• !balance: This shows you how much funds are in your your account.

• !tip: Tips are sent directly to @username on telegram.  Tag @NOSTipBot and mention !tip <amount> <@username>.  EXAMPLE: @NOSTipBot !tip 1 @user will send a 1 NOS (XNOS) tip to another user.

• !account: Returns the account number.  You can use this to deposit more NOS (XNOS) to tip from your personal wallet.

• !withdraw: Proper usage is !withdraw nos_12345.  This will send the full balance of your tip account to another external NOS (XNOS) account.  Optional: You can include an amount to withdraw by sending !withdraw <amount> <address>.  Example: !withdraw 1 nos_123 would withdraw 1 Nos to account nos_123
